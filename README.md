This project is designed to assist vehicle owners who experience breakdowns in unfamiliar locations by
providing a user-friendly web application...
Location-Based Service: The application identies the user's location and displays nearby partnered
mechanic shops.
Emergency Fuel Supply: If a vehicle runs out of fuel, the service provides 1 liter of fuel to help the user
reach the nearest lling station.
Emergency Assistance: Users can quickly contact emergency lines or a patrolling department for
immediate help.
